Teacher: Good morning, class! Today, we have an important topic to discuss: the right to education. 

Can anyone tell me what the right to education means?

Student 1: It means that every child has the right to go to school and receive an education.

Teacher: That's right, Student 1. 
The right to education is a fundamental human right that ensures every child has access to quality education

Now, let me share a story with you all.

Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a young girl named Aisha. 
She was very eager to go to school and learn, but her family couldn't afford it.
Aisha's parents worked hard, but they struggled to make ends meet.

Student 2: That's sad. Why couldn't Aisha go to school?

Teacher: Well, you see, in some parts of the world, not all children have the opportunity to go to school.

But one day, Aisha's village learned about the importance of the right to education.

They decided to take action.

Student 3: What did they do?

Teacher: They came together as a community and spoke to their local government about the situation.
They asked for more schools to be built and for financial assistance to help children like Aisha go to school.

Student 4: Did it work?

Teacher: Yes, it did! The government listened to the community's plea and took action.
They built a new school in the village, and Aisha, along with many other children, finally got the chance to receive an education.

Now, here's a multiple-choice question for you all based on this story:
